# FRED-Populations
## The Population Files used by the FRED Application

We have synthetic population files available for States and Counties. You can access files for a particular county in a state or you can access the full population files for a state. Note: These (the state files) can be from ~18MB (Wyoming) to ~1GB (California) in size.

Note: The county files are named by a five-digit fips code (two-digit state code + three-digit county code). The state files  are named only by the two-digit state code.

**The files should be copied into $FRED_HOME/populations to enable FRED to access the data.**

These population files are used by FRED up to and including FRED-v2.8.1

FRED's U.S. synthetic populations uses the 2000 Decennial census and the 2005-2009 American Community Survey (ACS) as its sources of population counts and characteristics. This version also uses the Integrated Climate and Land Use System (ICLUS) gridded population dataset to place households across the landscape.
